Welcome to whatever this is. This is just the first post to have some content on the site. The information below has not been changed and is the original content of the Jekyll theme.

Code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
